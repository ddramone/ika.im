2 years ago, Ziko, Gego and I went to Zandvoort - a beautiful seaside town in Netherlands. We went there not for surfing, but to change the atmosphere, isolate ourselves from everything else except one big question - what to do with Stack.


I believe every Startup founder goes through the realization that it's time to burst your own bubble: adding more and more features doesn't mean you're truly advancing your product. Instead team has to pause, step back, and look at things with the fresh perspective. It happened to us as well, but a bit differently - it was quite dramatic, and also somewhat expected.

If you aren't familiar, Stack is a Spatial Browser - it accompanies Chrome to create and organize your little cozy corner in the internet. Turns out building browser-like application is quite challenging, and this blog-post is about the technology todays Stack is based on.


By the time we made our retreat to Zandvoort, we already had a first version of Stack up and running. Now we call it Stack Legacy. It was being actively used by roughly 15k global users. However, our Intercom was flooded by messages pinpointing unexpected behaviors, asking for missing features, but mostly, they were concerned about the performance. 

The problem with the performance was not some sort of memory leak in the codebase, it was the whole technology we were using. Everything was wrong.

## Stack Legacy


The initial version of Stack was started by Ziko in 2018 as a weekend project. He was working in the bank as a Software Engineer and he wanted to create an app that could bypass the company restrictions of skimming social media websites during the working hours. Additionally he wanted to do it efficiently by opening twitter, instagram and reddit side-by-side.

So, during the weekend, he span up Electron and created a simple SPA. It was rendering websites with predefined links using webview tag. In case you're not familiar with Electron webview tag works in a very similar fashion as iFrames: it is part of the DOM hierarchy, can be positioned using CSS, it takes a URL as a parameter and renders website content. After placing few webviews in a flex-box, a and surrounding it with a decent UI, it was ready for its Product Hunt debut

Cutting a long story short - it grabbed a lot of attention. As it happened, people were looking for new ways to interact with the internet. So, what originated as a 'tweetdeck for social media' evolved into a browser.

As the idea grew bigger, so did the team and the codebase. We loaded tons of features onto the initial codebase, but one thing was clear - Electron wasn't the right tool to build a browser-like application.
